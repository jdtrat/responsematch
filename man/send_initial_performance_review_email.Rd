      Hi `r params$full_name`,

      This year we're doing performance reviews differently.
      We've partnered with ResponseMatchÂ® to figure out how we,
       as a company, can help you better achieve your personal
       and professional goals.

      To do this, we'd like you to kick-off your review by logging
      in to **[this tool](`r params$employee_setup_link`)**
      with the following credentials.
      You'll be asked to indicate your manager and select up
      to three colleagues who can comment on your work.
      Once you do so, you'll receive a confirmation email
      with details on completing your review.

      **Password:** `r params$password`

      All the best,
