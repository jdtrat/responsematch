Hi `r params$full_name`,
      
This year we're doing performance reviews differently.
We've partnered with ResponseMatchÂ® to figure out how we, as a company, can help you better achieve your personal and professional goals.

To do this, we'd like you to kick-off your review by logging in to **[this tool](`r params$employee_setup_link`)** with the following credentials.
You'll be asked to indicate your manager and select up to three colleagues who can comment on your work. Once you do so, you'll receive a confirmation email with details on completing your review.
