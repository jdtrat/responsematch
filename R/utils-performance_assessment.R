#' Send Initial Performance Review Email
#'
#' @param email_rmd An RMarkdown document with the email's contents. Must have
#'   parameters 'employee_setup_link', 'full_name', and 'password' (see examples
#'   for details.)
#' @param employee_login_data_sheet_id The Google Sheet created as part of the
#'   performance review with [create_performance_review()] that contains the
#'   employees' full name, email, and password.
#' @param subject_line The subject of the message. If not provided, an empty
#'   string will be used (which is handled differently by email clients).
#' @param from_address The email address of the sender. Often this needs to be
#'   the same email address that is associated with the account actually sending
#'   the message. As with to, cc, and bcc, we can either supply a single email
#'   address or use a named character vector with the sender name and email
#'   address (e.g., `c("John Doe" = "john_doe@example.com"))`.
#' @param employee_setup_link Link to deployed Shiny app
#' @param emailCredentials Email credentials passed onto
#'   [blastula::smtp_send()].
#'
#' @return A data frame with the full name and email for those who were sent
#'   emails.

#'       Hi `r params$full_name`,
#'
#'       This year we're doing performance reviews differently.
#'       We've partnered with ResponseMatchÂ® to figure out how we,
#'        as a company, can help you better achieve your personal
#'        and professional goals.
#'
#'       To do this, we'd like you to kick-off your review by logging
#'       in to **[this tool](`r params$employee_setup_link`)**
#'       with the following credentials.
#'       You'll be asked to indicate your manager and select up
#'       to three colleagues who can comment on your work.
#'       Once you do so, you'll receive a confirmation email
#'       with details on completing your review.
